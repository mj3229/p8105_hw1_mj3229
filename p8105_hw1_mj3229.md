## Problem 1

## Loading the Dataset

``` r
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

## Analyzing the data

The early_january_weather data set contains information on the different
aspects of weather in the region, reported by EWR, throughout different
hours of the day. **origin** (weather station) **temp** (observed
temperature in F) **dewp** (dewpoint in F) **humid** (relative humidity)
**wind_dir** (wind direction in degrees) **wind_speed** (speed and gust
speed in mph) **visib** (visibility in miles) **time_hour** (date and
hour of the recording)

The dataset has a total of 358 rows and 15 columns. The mean temperature
is 39.5821229

## Creating a Scatter-plot

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_mj3229_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave("HW1_Scatterplot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```

*This plot is showing how temperature has fluctuated over time and
throughout the day. Generally, we see an upwards trend as we move
through the chart. There is however major fluctuation throughout the day
with temperatures rising and dropping by the hour. Humidity seems to be
higher in higher temperatures and vice versa.*

## Problem 2

## Creating a dataframe

``` r
homework_df = 
  tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 1),
  vec_logical = norm_samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c" , "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("low", "medium", "high",
                        "low", "medium", "high",
                        "low", "medium", "high",
                        "low")),
)
homework_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    norm_samp vec_logical vec_char vec_factor
    ##        <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1  -0.122   FALSE       a        low       
    ##  2   0.0237  TRUE        b        medium    
    ##  3   0.417   TRUE        c        high      
    ##  4  -1.13    FALSE       d        low       
    ##  5  -0.00871 FALSE       e        medium    
    ##  6   0.631   TRUE        f        high      
    ##  7   1.13    TRUE        g        low       
    ##  8   0.230   TRUE        h        medium    
    ##  9   0.884   TRUE        i        high      
    ## 10   0.706   TRUE        j        low

## Mean of each variable

``` r
mean(pull(homework_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.276738

``` r
mean(pull(homework_df, vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.7

*Mean does not work for vec_char because this value is not numeric or
logical*

``` r
mean(pull(homework_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(homework_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

*Mean does not work for vec_factor because this value is not numeric or
logical. Can be converted to find mean*

``` r
mean(pull(homework_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(homework_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

## Converting Variables

``` r
as.numeric(homework_df$vec_logical)
as.numeric(homework_df$vec_factor)
as.numeric(homework_df$vec_char)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

**Character** variables **cannot** be converted into a numerical value
while **factor** and **logical** variables **can be** converted into
numerical values as logical variables turned into 1 or 0 indicating TRUE
and FALSE respectively. **Factor** can be converted to numeric as they
are stored internally as integers.
